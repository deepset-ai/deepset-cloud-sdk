After the test, youâll walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. Your heart rate, blood pressure, and EKG will continue to be monitored until the levels begin returning to normal. Although the appointment lasts about 60 minutes, the exercise time is usually between 7 and 12 minutes. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the exercise stress test.
