A river delta is a landform that forms from deposition of sediment carried by a river as the flow leaves its mouth and enters slower-moving or standing water. This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or (more rarely) another river that cannot transport away the supplied sediment.Despite a popular legend, this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus.he delta of the St. Clair River between the Canadian province of Ontario and the U.S. state of Michigan is the largest delta emptying into a body of fresh water.
