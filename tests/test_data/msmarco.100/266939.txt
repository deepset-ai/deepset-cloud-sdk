Ladyfingers (often called savoiardi and in British English sponge fingers) are low density, dry, egg-based and sweet sponge biscuits roughly shaped like a large finger. They are a principal ingredient in many dessert recipes, such as trifles, charlottes, as fruit or chocolate gateau linings and for tiramisu.
