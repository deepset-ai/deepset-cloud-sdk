Medicaid, on the other hand, is a health care program for low-income individuals who could not otherwise afford health insurance. Medicaid is funded in part by the government and the state in which the enrollee lives. The states establish their own eligibility standards and services for Medicaid, while the federal government establishes criteria for Medicare.
