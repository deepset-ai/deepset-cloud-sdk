If you do not want to buy the recommended keratin treatment shampoo, look for one which is free of sulfates and sodium chloride. Remember, the recommended shampoo will not only protect your treatment but also enhance it. Like a spray tan, every time you wash your hair, you will fade a little bit of the coating off.
