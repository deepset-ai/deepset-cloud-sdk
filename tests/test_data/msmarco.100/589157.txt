Figure 3 illustrates a distribution which by strict definition is unimodal. However, confusingly, and mostly with continuous distributions, when a pdf function has multiple local maxima it is common to refer to all of the local maxima as modes of the distribution.s the term mode has multiple meanings, so does the term unimodal. Strictly speaking, a mode of a discrete probability distribution is a value at which the probability mass function (pmf) takes its maximum value.
