Robert G. Ingersoll (1833 - 1899) The ozone layer plays an important role in the atmosphere. It protects life on earth from the full force of the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation. However, many household products and appliances release substances to the atmosphere that causes the hole in the ozone layer.
